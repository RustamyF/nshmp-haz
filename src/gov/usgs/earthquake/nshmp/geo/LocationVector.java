/**
 * This class encapsulates information describing a vector between two
 * {@code Location}s. Internally, this vector is defined by the azimuth
 * (bearing) and the horizontal and vertical separation between the points. Note
 * that a {@code LocationVector} from point A to point B is not the complement
 * of that from point B to A. Although the horizontal and vertical components
 * will be the same, the azimuth will likely change by some value other than
 * 180°.
 *
 * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Although a {@code LocationVector} will function in any
 * reference frame, the convention in seismology and that adopted in OpenSHA is
 * for depth to be positive down. Also, azimuth is stored internally in radians
 * for computational convenience. Be sure to use the {@link #azimuth()}
 * (radians) or // {@link #azimuthDegrees()} (decimal-degrees) where
 * appropriate.
