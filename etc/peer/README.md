#### PEER Test Cases

The PEER PSHA verification project developed a number of source models for the purpose of examining the sensitivity of seismic hazard to different PSHA implementations (codes). These test cases are used as end-to-end unit tests in `nshmp-haz`. 

For more information, including source model specifications, result tables, and summary report, please see the [PEER](https://peer.berkeley.edu/peer-reports) Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis Code Verification Report - 2018/03.
